'''  "Subscriptions":-

A new TV streaming service was recently started in Chefland called the Chef-TV.
A group of N friends in Chefland want to buy Chef-TV subscriptions. We know that 6 people can share one Chef-TV subscription. Also, the cost of one Chef-TV subscription is X rupees. Determine the minimum total cost that the group of N friends will incur so that everyone in the group is able to use Chef-TV.

"Input Format":-
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and X — the size of the group of friends and the cost of one subscription.

"Output Format":-
For each test case, output the minimum total cost that the group will incur so that everyone in the group is able to use Chef-TV.'''
