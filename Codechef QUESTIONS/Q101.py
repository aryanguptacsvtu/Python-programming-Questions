'''      "Best of Two":-

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a regular six faced dice 3 times.
The score of a player is the sum of the values of the highest 2 rolls. The player with the highest score wins, and the game ends in a Tie if both players have the same score.Find the winner of the game or determine whether it is a tie.


"Input Format":-
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains six space-separated integers A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3 â€” the values Alice gets in her 3 dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his 3 dice rolls.

"Output Format":-
For each test case, output on a new line Alice if Alice wins, Bob if Bob wins and Tie in case of a tie.
Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings tie, TIE, Tie, and tIe are considered identical.
