'''  "Maximise the Tastiness":-

Chef is making a dish that consists of exactly two ingredients. He has four ingredients A,B,C and D with tastiness a,b,c,and d respectively. He can use either A or B as the first ingredient and either C or D as the second ingredient.
The tastiness of a dish is the sum of tastiness of its ingredients. Find the maximum possible tastiness of the dish that the chef can prepare.


"Input Format":-
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers a,b,c,and d â€” the tastiness of the four ingredients.

"Output Format":-
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible tastiness of the dish that chef can prepare.'''
