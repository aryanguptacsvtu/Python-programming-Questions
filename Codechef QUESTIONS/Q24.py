'''  "Chef and NextGen":-

Chef is currently working for a secret research group called NEXTGEN.Moving forward, the project requires some government funding for completion, which comes under one condition: to prove its worth, the project should power Chefland by generating at least A units of power each year for the next B years.
Help Chef determine whether the group will get funded assuming that the moon has X grams of Helium-3 and 1 gram of Helium-3 can provide Y units of power.

"Input Format":-
The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of testcases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers A,B,X,Y respectively.

"Output Format":-
For each test case print on a single line the answer â€” Yes if NEXTGEN satisfies the government's minimum requirements for funding and No otherwise.
You may print each character of the answer string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
